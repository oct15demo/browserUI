        <intro>
            This node uses the data from a table to construct a PMML K Nearest Neighbors model.
            The node does not classify any values. It just writes all columns that are used for
            the calculation of the neighbors into the PMML document.
            When limiting the number of records to add to the PMML, make sure that the selected portion
            is still representative to avoid loosing data for some classes completely.
