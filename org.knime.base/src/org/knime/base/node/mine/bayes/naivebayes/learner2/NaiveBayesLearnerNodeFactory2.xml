	<shortDescription>
		Creates a naive Bayes model from the given classified data.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			The node creates a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier">Bayesian model</a> from 
			the given training data. It
			calculates the number of rows per attribute value per class for
			nominal attributes and the Gaussian distribution for numerical
			attributes. The created model could be used in the naive Bayes
			predictor to predict the class membership of unclassified data.
            
            The node displays a warning message if any columns are ignored due to unsupported data types.
            For example Bit Vector columns are ignored when the PMML compatibility flag is enabled since they are 
            not supported by the PMML standard.
		</intro>
		<option name="Classification Column">
		    The class value column.
	    </option>
        <option name="Maximum number of unique nominal values per attribute">
            All nominal columns with more unique values than the defined number
            will be skipped during learning.
        </option>
        <option name="Default probability">
            A probability of zero for a given attribute/class value pair requires special attention. 
            Without adjustment, a probability of zero would exercise an absolute veto over a likelihood in which that 
            probability appears as a factor. Therefore, the Bayes model incorporates a default probability parameter 
            that specifies a default (usually very small) probability to use in lieu of zero probability for a 
            given attribute/class value pair. Set to zero for no correction.
        </option>
        <option name="Ignore missing values">
            By default the node uses the missing value information to improve the prediction result.
            Since the PMML standard does not support this option and ignores missing values this option is disabled 
            if the PMML compatibility option is selected and missing values are ignored.
        </option>
		<option name="Create PMML 4.2 compatible model">
			Select this option to create a model which is compliant with the 
            <a href="http://www.dmg.org/v4-2/NaiveBayes.html">PMML 4.2 standard</a>.
            The PMML 4.2 standard ignores missing values and does not support bit vectors. Therefore bit vector columns
            and missing values are ignored during learning and prediction if this option is selected.
            <p>
            Even if this option is not selected the node creates a valid PMML model. However the model contains 
            KNIME specific information to store missing value and bit vector information. This information is used in 
            the KNIME Naive Bayes Predictor to improve the prediction result but ignored by any other PMML compatible 
            predictor which might result in different prediction results.
