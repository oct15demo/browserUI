	<name>Naive Bayes Predictor</name>

	<shortDescription>
		Uses the PMML naive Bayes model from the naive Bayes learner to predict
		the class membership of each row in the input data.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Predicts the class per row based on the learned model. The class
			probability is the product of the probability per attribute and the
			probability of the class attribute itself.
			<p>
			The probability for nominal values is the number of occurrences of
			the class value with the given value divided by the number of total
			occurrences of the class value. The probability of numerical values
			is calculated by assuming a normal distribution per attribute.

        <option name="Change prediction column name">
            When set, you can change the name of the prediction column.(The
            default is: <tt>Prediction (</tt>trainingColumn<tt>)</tt>.)
        </option>
        <option name="Append columns with normalized class distribution">
            If selected a column is appended for each class instance with the
            normalized probability of this row being member of this class.
        </option>
        <option name="Suffix for probability columns">
            Suffix for the normalized distribution columns. Their names are like:
            <tt>P (</tt>trainingColumn<tt>=</tt>value<tt>)</tt>.
