    <shortDescription>Creates a crisp center based clustering.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			This node outputs the cluster centers for a predefined number of
			clusters (no dynamic number of clusters).
			K-means performs a crisp clustering that assigns a data
			vector to exactly one cluster. The algorithm terminates when the
			cluster assignments do not change anymore.<br />
			The clustering algorithm uses the Euclidean distance on the selected
			attributes. The data is not normalized by the node (if required,
			you should consider to use the "Normalizer" as a preprocessing step).			
		</intro>
		<option name="number of clusters">
			The number of clusters (cluster centers) to be created.
	    </option>
		<option name="max number of iterations">
		    The number of iterations after which the algorithm terminates,
			independent of the accuracy improvement of the cluster centers.
		</option>
		<option name="Enable Hilite Mapping">
            If enabled, the hiliting of a cluster row (2nd output) will hilite all rows of this
            cluster in the input table and the 1st output table. Depending on the number of rows, enabling this 
            feature might consume a lot of memory.
