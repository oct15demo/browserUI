	<shortDescription>
		Searches for frequent itemsets with a certain minimum support 
	    in a set of transactions and optionally generates association rules 
	    with a predefined confidence value from them.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Searches for frequent itemsets meeting the user-defined minimum 
			support criterion and, optionally, creates association rules from 
			them. The column containing the transactions (BitVectors or 
			Collections) has to be selected. The minimum 
			support as an absolute number must be provided (therefore check the number
			of transactions to obtain a sensible criterion). If the frequent itemsets
			should be free (unconstrained) or closed or maximal has also be defined.
			Closed itemsets are frequent itemsets, which have no superset with the 
			same support, thus providing all the information from free itemsets 
			in a compressed form. Maximal itemsets are sets which have no 
			frequent superset at all. The maximal itemset length must also be 
			defined. If association rules are generated, a confidence value has to be
			provided. The confidence is a value to define how often the rule is 
			right. Association rules generated here are in the form to have only one
			item in the consequence.
			The underlying data structure used by the algorithm can be either an
			ARRAY or a TIDList. Choose the former when there are many 
			transactions an less items, and	the latter if the structure of the 
			input data is vice versa.

	<option name="Column containing transactions">
		Select the column containing the transactions (BitVector or Collection)
		to mine for frequent itemsets or association rules. There must be at 
		least one, since this is the only valid input for the subgroup miner.
	</option>
	<option name="Minimum support (0-1)">
		An itemset is considered to be frequent if there are at least "minimum
		support" transactions, where the itemset occurs. Make sure, to have here
		a meaningful number in proportion of the number of rows of the input.
	</option>
	<option name="Underlying data structure">
        Either ARRAY or TIDList: ARRAY is recommended when the number of 
        transactions (rows) is larger than the number of items, and the TIDList
        if the number of rows is small and the number of items large. In
        general, the ARRAY option needs more memory and is faster, whereas the 
        TIDList need less memory but is slower.
    </option>   
	<option name="Itemset type">
		Choose either free, closed or maximal. Free are mostly redundant, closed
		provide the most information and maximal may hide some information.
	</option>
	<option name="Maximal itemset length">
		The maximal length of the resulting itemsets. A lower value may reduce 
		the runtime if there are very long frequent itemsets.
	</option>
	<option name="Output association rules">
		Check if association rules should be generated out of the frequent 
		itemsets. Note: association rules are always generated from free 
		frequent itemsets and are constrained to have only one item in the
		consequence.
	</option>	
	<option name="Minimum confidence">
		The confidence is a measure for "how often the rule is right". Thus, how
		often, if the items in the antecedence appeared also the consequence 
		occurred in the transactions.
