    <shortDescription>
        Renders a decision tree view on an image (PNG).

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>        
        Renders a decision tree view on an image. Currently supported image
        type is PNG. The data input is optional. It can be used to provide a
        column with color information. This color information is needed for 
        the chart in the nodes of the decision tree.
        </intro>
        
        <option name="Width (in Pixel)">
            The width of the image.
        </option>        
        <option name="Collapse Table">
            The height of the image.
        </option>
        <option name="Tree Scaling">
            To make sure that the decision tree is completely rendered on the
            image you would choose <b>Shrink to image area</b>. With 
            <b>Fit to image area</b> the tree may also be scaled up to fit the
            image area. Finally, <b>Fixed value</b> gives control over the
            scaling magnitude.            
        </option>
        <option name="Zoom">
            The scaling magnitude for the tree scaling option <b>Fixed value</b>. 
        </option>
        <option name="Branch Display">
            With this options you can restrict the number of branches (nodes) 
            of the tree rendered on the image. Using 
            <b>Unfold with data coverage</b>, all branches will be unfolded that
            have a total data coverage greater than the given value. With
            <b>Unfold to level</b>, the tree will be unfolded to the given
            level where the root is on level 0 and its children on level 1.
        </option>
        <option name="Node Display">
            Controls the style how the nodes of the tree are displayed. You 
            can choose to hide the table ore the chart in the nodes. Note, that
            the chart will show up only when the data input provides a column
            with color information.
