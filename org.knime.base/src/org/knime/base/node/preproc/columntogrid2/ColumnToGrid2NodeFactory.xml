	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Breaks a selected column (or set of columns) into 
            new columns, such that they align in a grid. This is useful for 
            displaying, for instance a column containing images in a grid that 
            can then be shown in a report table. The number of grid columns is
            to be set in the dialog, the number of rows is determined 
            accordingly. 
        </intro>
        <option name="Grid Column Count">The number of grid columns, this 
            should be a relatively small number.
        </option>
        <option name="Column Filter">Select the column(s) that are to 
            be displayed in a grid. If multiple columns are selected, the entire
            set will constitute a grid column.
        </option>
        <option name="Enable Grouping">Select this option and choose a group 
            column in order to separate input rows that do not belong to the 
            same group. This is useful when visualizing, e.g. clustering 
            results, whereby records from different clusters are represented 
            by different output rows. The group column will be another column 
            in the output table.
        </option>
