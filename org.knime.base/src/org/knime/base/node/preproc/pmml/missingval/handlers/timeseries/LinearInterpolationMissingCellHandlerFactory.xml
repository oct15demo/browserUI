<missingcellhandler name="Linear Interpolation" xmlns="http://knime.org/missingval/v1.0">
            This missing value handler replaces missing values with the linear interpolation
            between the previous and next encountered
            non-missing value in the column it is configured for.
            When dealing with tables that have a large number of rows but not too many columns
            that need missing value replacement, the option to use disk backed statistics
            avoid flooding of the main memory. This should be used with caution, at is generally
            much slower than in-memory statistics.
            This missing value handler does not produce standard PMML 4.2!
