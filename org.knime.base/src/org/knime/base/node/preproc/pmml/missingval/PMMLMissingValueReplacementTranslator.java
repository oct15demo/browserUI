 *  ECLIPSE and the GNU GPL Version 3 applying for KNIME, provided the

 *  propagation of ECLIPSE together with KNIME.
 *
 *  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
 *  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,

 *  Nodes are deemed to be separate and independent programs and to not be
