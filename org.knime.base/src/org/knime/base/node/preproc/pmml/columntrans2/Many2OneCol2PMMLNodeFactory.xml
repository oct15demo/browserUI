    <shortDescription>
        Transforms the values of multiple columns into a single column while generating PMML. 
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        Transforms the values of multiple columns into a single column
        depending on the include method and documents the transformation in PMML. 
        If set to binary the condensed
        column's value is set to the name of the first column with value 1.
        If the include method is maximum or minimum the value of the
        condensed column is set to the name of the column which, of all
        included columns, has the largest or smallest value. If the include
        method is binary and all columns are 0 the condensed column will
        contain a missing value.

                When include method is RegExPattern, this is the pattern used.
