    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			Transposes the entire input table by swapping rows and columns. The new column
		    names are provided by the former (old) row IDs and the new row identifiers are 
		    the former (old) column names. The new column type is the most specific
		    base type and applies to all cells in one row.
		</intro>
		<option name=" Chunk size (columns):">
		      number of columns read during one iteration over the table, increasing this
		      value yields faster execution time but also increases memory consumption.
		</option>
