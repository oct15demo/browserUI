	<name>Edit Nominal Domain</name>

	<shortDescription>
        Manages possible values of domains.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				Resorts and/or inserts interactively possible values to the
				domain
				of a
				certain column
				of the input table. This allows the configuration
				of
				downstream
				nodes on an amended domain list,
				e.g. a histogram that
				should show an empty bin for a value that is not
				actually present in
				the data. Also,
				the sorting on the domain values can be changed. This
				might be useful
				for instance for many predictor nodes,
				which add a new
				column for each possible value to the prediction output
				table,
				whereby the order of the
				columns is determined by the ordering in the
				domain.
			</p>
		</intro>

		<option name="Select column">
			Selects the column for which the domain values
			should be edited.
			Non-string typed
			columns are filtered out. A column name with red border indicates that the
			domain values for this
			columns were previously configured but the column either no longer
			exists or has a different type (no string column anymore). Red written
			domain value orderings can
			be edited
			as
			others and in addition deleted.
			(See the
			<b>Reset/Delete</b>
			option)
		</option>

		<option name="Add">
			Creates a new cell with the given value and
			inserts it at the selected
			position. Self created cells are
			green
			marked in the possible value list.
		</option>
		<option name="Remove">
			Removes all selected self created cells (green
			marked)
			or cells which are not contained in the possible
			value set of
			the original column specification (red marked). It is not
			possible to
			remove
			other possible values, i.e. the possible values defined by the
			original column specification, as that might corrupt the table
			consistency.
		</option>
		<option name="Sort alphabetical [A-Z, Z-A]">
			Sorts the elements in alphabetical order ascending
			(A-Z)
			or descending (Z-A).
		</option>
		<option name="Move one step [Up, Down]">
			Moves the selected element(s) one up or down. If
			the top or the bottom
			of the list is reached, the selected element(s)
			is/are enqueued on the
			other end of the table again.
		</option>
		<option name="Move first/last">
			Moves the selected element(s) to the top or at the
			end of the table.
		</option>
		<option name="Reset/Delete">
			Restores the original domain value list as in the
			input table. If a not existing but previously configured column is
			selected (written in red), this button is labeled
			with 'Delete' and
			deletes the stored configuration for the selected column.
		</option>
		<option name="If a configured columns is not present in data">
			Determines if the execution should either fail or
			the column should be ignored if a configured column does not exist in
			the input table.
		</option>
		<option name="If a configured columns has an incompatible type">
			Determines if the execution should either fail or
			the column should be ignored if
			the types of a configured column are
			not equal.
