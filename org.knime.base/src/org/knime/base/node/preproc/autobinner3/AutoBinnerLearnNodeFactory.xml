	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node allows to group numeric data in intervals - called
			bins.
			There are two naming options for the bins and two methods which
			define
			the number and the range of values that fall in a bin.
			Please
			use the "Numeric Binner" node if you want to define custom bins.
		</intro>

		<option name="Column Selection: ">
			Columns in the include list are processed
			separately. The columns in the
			exclude list are omitted by the node.
		</option>
		<option name="Binning Method:">
			Use
			<b>Fixed number of bins</b>
			for bins with equal
			<b>width</b>
			over the domain range or bins that have an equal
			<b>frequency</b>
			of element occurrences. Use
			<b>Sample quantiles</b>
			to produces
			bins corresponding to the given list of probabilities. The
			smallest
			element corresponds to a probability of 0 and the largest do
			probability
			of 1. The applied estimation method is
			<a
				href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile#Estimating_the_quantiles_of_a_population">Type 7</a>
			which is the default
			method in R, S and Excel.
		</option>
		<option name="Bin Naming:">
			Use
			<b>Numbered</b>
			for bins labeled by an integer with prefix "Bin",
			<b>Borders</b>
			for labels using '"(a,b]"' interval notation or
			<b>Midpoints</b>
			for labels that show the midpoint of the interval.
		</option>
		<option name="Force integer bounds">
			Forces the bounds of the interval to be integers.
			The decimal bounds
			will be converted so that the lower bound of the
			first interval will
			be the floor of the lowest value and the upper
			bound of the last
			interval will be the ceiling of the highest value.
			The edges that
			separate the intervals will be the ceiling of the
			decimal edges.
			Duplicates of edges will be removed.
			<br />
			<br />
			Examples:
			<br />
			[0.1,0.9], (0.9,1.8] -> [0,1], (1,2]
			<br />
			[3.9,4.1], (4.1,4.9], (4.9,5.1] -> [3,5], (5,6]
		</option>
		<option name="Replace target column(s):">
			If set the columns in the include list are
			replaced by the binned
			columns
			otherwise columns named with suffix
			'[binned]' are appended.
		</option>
		<option name="Advanced formatting">
			If enabled the format of the doubles in the labels
			can be configured by
			the options in this tab.
		</option>
		<option name="Output format">
			Specify the output format. The number 0.00000035239 will be displayed
			as 3.52E-7 with
			<b>Standard String</b>
			, 0.000000352 with
			<b>Plain String (no exponent)</b>
			and 352E-9 with
			<b>Engineering String</b>
			.
		</option>
		<option name="Precision">
			The scale of the double values to round to. If the
			scale is reduced
			the specified rounding mode is applied.
		</option>
		<option name="Precision mode">
			The type of precision to which the values are
			rounded. Decimal
			places, the default option rounds to the specified
			decimal places,
			whereas significant figures rounds to significant
			figures or
			numbers.
		</option>
		<option name="Rounding mode">
			The rounding mode which is applied when double values are rounded.
			The rounding mode specifies the rounding behavior. Seven different
			rounding modes are available:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li>UP: Rounding mode to round away from zero.</li>
				<li>DOWN: Rounding mode to round towards zero.</li>
				<li>CEILING: Rounding mode to round towards positive infinity.</li>
				<li>FLOOR: Rounding mode to round towards negative infinity.</li>
				<li>HALF_UP: Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor"
					unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round up.
				</li>
				<li>HALF_DOWN: Rounding mode to round towards "nearest neighbor"
					unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case round down.
				</li>
				<li>HALF_EVEN: Rounding mode to round towards the "nearest neighbor"
					unless both neighbors are equidistant, in which case, round towards
					the even neighbor.
				</li>
			</ul>
			For a detailed description of each rounding mode please see the
			<a
