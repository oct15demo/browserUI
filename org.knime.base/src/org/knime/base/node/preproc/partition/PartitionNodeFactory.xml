    <shortDescription>Splits table into two partitions.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
	        The input table is split into two partitions (i.e. row-wise),
			e.g. train and test data. The two partitions are available at the
			two output ports. The following options are available in the dialog:
		</intro>
		<option name="Absolute">
			Specify the absolute number of rows in the first partition. If there are
			less rows than specified here, all rows are entered into the first 
			table, while the second table contains no rows.
		</option>
		<option name="Relative">
			The percentage of the number of rows in the input table that are
			in the first partition. It must be between 0 and 100, inclusively.
		</option>
        <option name="Take from top">This mode puts the top-most rows 
        into the first output table and the remainder in the second table.</option>        
        <option name="Linear sampling">
            This mode always includes the first and the last row and selects the remaining rows linearly over the whole
            table (e.g. every third row). This is useful to downsample a sorted column while maintaining minimum and
            maximum value.
        </option>
		<option name="Draw randomly">
			Random sampling of all rows, you may optionally specify a fixed seed (see below).
		</option>
        <option name="Stratified sampling">
            Check this button if you want stratified sampling, i.e. the distribution
            of values in the selected column is (approximately) retained in 
            the output tables. 
            You may optionally specify a fixed seed (see below).
        </option>
        <option name="Use random seed">
            If either random or stratified sampling is selected, you may enter a fixed seed here
            in order to get reproducible results upon re-execution. If you do not specify a seed,
            a new random seed is taken for each execution. 
        </option>
