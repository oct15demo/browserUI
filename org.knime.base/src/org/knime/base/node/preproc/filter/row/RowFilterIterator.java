/**
 * Row iterator of the row filter table. Wraps a given row iterator and forwards
 * only rows that are approved by a given
 * {@link IRowFilter}. Also a
 * range of row numbers can be specified and a flag to only include or exclude
 * rows within that range. (The range feature is ANDed to the filter match
 * result. If another operation on the row number is required an appropreate
 * filter has to be created.) <br>
 * The order of which the conditions are evaluated is as follows: If a range is
 * specified, the row number is checked against the specified range, only if it
 * matches the filter is asked to do its match. If the row number range fails it
 * is also checked if the end of the result table is reached due to the range
 * restrictions. (This should speed up the atEnd() check as we don't have to
 * traverse through the entire input table - which is actually the reason we
 * handle the row number range not in a filter.)
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: Iterating may be slow as the iterator must potentially skip many rows
 * until it encounters a row to be returned. This iterator does also support
 * cancelation/progress information using an
 * {@link org.knime.core.node.ExecutionMonitor}.
