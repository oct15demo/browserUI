        <intro>
        Node allows to apply annotations to sets of hilit rows within an Interactive View:
        Within the interactive view, an annotation string can be entered which is then 
        appended to all hilit rows. During the re-execution (press Apply button) of this node, the annotation
        is appended as a new column, 'Anno #X', to the end of the input table. When the node is reset, 
        all annotations are discarded.
        </intro>
        <option name="Append Annotation">
            Enter a new, non-empty annotation string which is then applied to 
            the current set of hilit rows. All subsequent annotations to the 
            same row, will be appended to the current string and separated by 
            comma. If selected, a new column with the current annotation is
            appended to the table.
        </option>
        <option name="Apply">
            If pressed, the new annotation is appended as either a new column to all currently hilit rows or to the last
            annotation column. This call will re-execute the node and immediately provide the new output table with the 
            (additional) annotation column.
        </option>
    </fullDescription>
    
    <interactiveView name="Annotation View">
    	Appends annotations to the current set of hilit rows shown in this
        view, together with all rows to which annotation(s) have been appended.
