    <name>HiLite Row Splitter</name>
    <shortDescription>Partitions input rows based on their current hilite status.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
			This node separates hilited from non-hilited rows in the
			input data according to their hilite status at the time of 
			node's execution. Both tables are then passed to out-ports. Note, 
			hilite changes that happen after the execution are not reflected 
			in the output tables. You will need to reset and execute the node
			again if you want to get a partitioning based on the changed state.
