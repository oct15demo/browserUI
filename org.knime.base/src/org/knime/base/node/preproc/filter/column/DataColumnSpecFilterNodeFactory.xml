	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node allows columns to be filtered from the input table while 
			only the remaining columns are passed to the output table. Within 
			the dialog, columns can be moved between the Include and Exclude 
			list.
		</intro>
		
		<option name="Include">
			This list contains the column names that are included in the 
			output table.
		</option>
		
		<option name="Enforce Inclusion">
			Select this option to enforce the current inclusion list to stay
			the same even if the input table specification changes. If some
			of the included columns are not available anymore, a warning
			is displayed. (New columns will automatically be added to the
			exclusion list.)
		</option>
		
		<option name="Select">
			Use these buttons to move columns between the Include and Exclude 
			list.
		</option>
		
		<option name="Search">
			Use one of these fields to search either within the Include
			or Exclude list for certain column names or name substrings.
			Repeated clicking of the search button marks the next column that 
			matches the search text. The check box 'Mark all search hits' causes
			all matching columns to be selected making them movable between
			the two lists.
		</option>
		
	    <option name="Exclude">
	    	This list contains the column names of the input table that are 
	    	excluded at the output table.

        <option name="Enforce Exclusion">

            the same even if the input table specification changes. If some
            of the excluded columns are not available anymore, a warning
            is displayed. (New columns will automatically be added to the
            inclusion list.)
