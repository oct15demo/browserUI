		certain percentage.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node removes all columns from the input table which contain more missing values than 
			a certain percentage.
			The filtering is only applied to the columns in the input list of the column filter panel.
		</intro>
		
		<option name="Include">
			This list contains the column names which are filtered.
		</option>
		
		<option name="Enforce Inclusion">
			Select this option to enforce the current inclusion list to stay
			the same even if the input table specification changes. If some
			of the included columns are not available anymore, a warning
			is displayed. (New columns will automatically be added to the
			exclusion list.)
		</option>
		
		<option name="Select">
			Use these buttons to move columns between the Include and Exclude 
			list.
		</option>
		
		<option name="Search">
			Use one of these fields to search either within the Include
			or Exclude list for certain column names or name substrings.
			Repeated clicking of the search button marks the next column that 
			matches the search text. The check box 'Mark all search hits' causes
			all matching columns to be selected making them movable between
			the two lists.
		</option>
		
	    <option name="Exclude">
	    	This list contains the column names of the input table which will be passed to the output
	    	table without applying the missing value filter. 
	    </option>

        <option name="Enforce Exclusion">
            Select this option to enforce the current exclusion list to stay
            the same even if the input table specification changes. If some
            of the excluded columns are not available anymore, a warning
            is displayed. (New columns will automatically be added to the
            inclusion list.)
        </option>

		<option name="Missing value threshold">All selected columns with at least this percentage of 
		missing values are filtered out.</option>
