 * This model is an extension of the AbstractParallelNodeModel that uses a sub
 * pool of the global KNIME thread pool. The default maximum number of threads
 * for each of these nodes is {@link #DEFAULT_MAX_THREAD_COUNT} which is
 * currently set to the number of CPUs + 1 (this is only a rule of thumb,
 * nothing more). The maximum number can be adjusted by calling
 * {@link #setMaxThreads(int)} but the real maximum is still determined by the
 * global thread pool.

 * @deprecated Use either the {@link ThreadedColAppenderNodeModel} if you want
 *             to add columns to the input tables and the number of rows stays
 *             the same, or the {@link ThreadedTableBuilderNodeModel} if you
 *             want to build a completely new table.
