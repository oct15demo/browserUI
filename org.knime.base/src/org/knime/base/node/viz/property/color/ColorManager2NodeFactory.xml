	<name>Color Manager</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
	    Assigns colors to a selected nominal or numeric column.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
	    Colors can be assigned for either nominal (possible values
	    have to be available) or numeric columns (with lower and upper bounds).
	    If these bounds are not available, a <i>'?'</i> is provided as a minimum
	    and maximum value. The values are then computed during execute.
	    If a column attribute is selected, the color can be changed with the
        color chooser.
		</intro>
		
    <option name="Column(s): ">
	    Select the column whose possible values or ranges should be used for 
	    color selection.
    </option>
    <option name="Nominal: ">
	    Assigns colors based on the possible attribute values of the selected 
	    column. The colors are set independently for each attribute value.
    </option>
    <option name="Range: ">
	    Assigns a color gradient based on a numeric attribute. If 
	    the range is known, the minimum and maximum are displayed in the list,
	    otherwise a '?' is shown. The color is determined by the position of 
	    the attribute's value within the numeric range: the corresponding color 
	    is set at the same position in the gradient.
    </option>
    <option name="Alpha: ">
        Adjust the color's alpha component in the range of 0..255. Please note,
        alpha composition is expensive in cases when operations performed are 
        not hardware-accelerated.
