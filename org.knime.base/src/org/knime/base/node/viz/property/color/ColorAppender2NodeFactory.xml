		<intro>
		<p>
		Assigns an existing color model to a table. 		
		If a color model was configured
	    for a dataset and this color model should be reused, the model outport 
	    of the Color Manager should be connected to the model inport of the Color Appender.
	    In the Color Appender the color model could also be applied to another column.
	    This works for numeric columns unrestricted and for nominal columns only if 
	    the possible values are exactly the same. In general a color model for nominal values
	    is incompatible with a color model for numeric values.
	    </p>
	    
	    <p>
	    This may be useful if the column for which the color model is defined gets
	    lost somewhere in the workflow or is replaced by another column or if there
	    are two different datasets with the same class column. 
	    </p>
		</intro>
	    <option name="Append colors to: ">
		    Select the column to apply color settings to. It might be the same column, 
		    a different numeric column for which the color settings should be reused, 
		    or a nominal column if the color model was defined for nominal values. 
		    Then the possible values must be exactly the same. Color models
		    for numeric and for nominal values are not compatible with each other.
