	<shortDescription>
	    Assigns shapes to one selected nominal column.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		<p>
		Assigns (different) shapes for each attribute value of one nominal column, 
		i.e. for each possible value. Supporting views then render datapoints 
		with the shape associated with the corresponding attribute value. 
		If there is for example a dataset with two different 
		classes ("class1" and "class2"), "class1" may have a circle and 
		"class2" a triangle assigned. When looking at the dataset the values 
		can easily be distinguished through their shape.
        </p>
        <p>
        In the dialog the nominal column with the possible values may be selected.
        The possible values appear in the left column and the shape can be set
        in the right column of the table by clicking on it and selecting the 
        desired shape.
        </p>

    <option name="Select nominal column: ">
