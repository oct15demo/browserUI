    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Creates a lift chart. Additionally, a chart for the cumulative 
        percent of responses captured is shown. A lift chart is used to evaluate 
        a predictive model. The higher the lift (the difference between the "lift" line 
        and the base line), the better performs the predictive model.
        The lift is the ratio between the results obtained with and without the 
        predictive model. 
        It is calculated as number of positive hits (e .g. responses) divided by
        the average number of positives without model.
        The data table must have a column containing probabilities and a nominal 
        column, containing the actual labels.
        At first, the data is sorted by probability, divided into deciles,
        then the actual labels are counted and the average rate is calculated.

        <option name="Column containing true labels">Nominal column containing the actual labels, e. g. if a person responded</option>
        <option name="Response Label">The label for a positive value (hit).</option>
        <option name="Column containing score (probabilities)">Numeric column containing the predicted score in probabilities of the model</option>
        <option name="Interval width in %">The width in which the data is separated before counting.
