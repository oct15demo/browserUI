	<shortDescription>
		Displays data in a histogram view. Hiliting is not supported.
	</shortDescription>	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		<p>Displays a histogram view with different viewing options.</p>
		<p>The user can change the following view properties on the fly:
			<ol>
			<li>Aggregation method (count, summary, average)</li>
			<li>Bar size</li>
			<li>Show empty intervals</li>
			<li>Show missing value bar</li>
			<li>Layout</li>
			<li>Zooming</li>
			<li>...</li>
			</ol>
			The bars are colored in proportion to the aggregation value.
			Hiliting is not supported.
		</p>
        <p>
        The <b>Invalid_values bin</b> contains values that can not be assigned to a regular bin e.g. NaN for a double value.
        The bin is displayed by default if the selected binning column contains an invalid value in the input table.
        To hide it go to the "Bin settings tab" of the node view and deselect the "Show invalid value bin" option.        
        </p>
		<p>All automatically created bins, except the first one, are
		left open intervals (a,b] where a is excluded and b is included in 
		the interval. To cover all values the first interval is a closed 
		interval [a,b] where a and b are included. In order to provide nicer bin 
        intervals the left border is set to 0 if possible.</p>
		<p>This view is particularly well suited for extremely large datasets.
		For more interaction and hiliting support use the 
		"Interactive Histogram" node.</p>
		<p><b>Only columns with a valid domain are available in this view.
		To set the domain use the DomainCalculator or ColumnFilter node!</b></p>

		<option name="Display all rows">
		    If selected the histogram view displays all rows of the incoming data.
	    </option>
	    <option name="No. of rows to display">

	    <option name="Binning column">
	     	This is the column to be shown on the x axis of the histogram view.
	     	For numerical values the number of bars can be adjusted later 
	     	in the 'Bar settings' section of view properties.
   	    </option>
   	  	<option name="Aggregation column">
   	  		This is the column to be used as the bar value and displayed on the
   	  		y axis. Only numerical values with a valid domain are allowed. 
   	  		The aggregation method can be adjusted later in the 
   	  		'Aggregation setting' section of view properties .
   	    </option>
   	  	<option name="Number of bins">
   	  		The number of bins to create for a numerical x axis column.
   	  		If the selected x column is nominal this value is ignored.
