		Draws enrichment curves
	</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This node draws enrichment curves often used in virtual screening.
			For this the user can choose a column by which the data is sorted and
			represents the x-axis. The values on the y-axis are formed by the sum
			of the hits in a second column that is also selected by the user. A
			row is considered a hit if the activity value is greater than 0. The
			steeper the resulting curve, the better the enrichment is. Optionally
			the y-axis can show the sum of the activity values instead of the
			number of hits.
			<br />
			The two gray lines in the view show the enrichment if the data points
			were ordered randomly (lower diagonal) and the optimal enrichment if
			all hits are ordered before the first non-hit (upper diagonal).
		</intro>

		<option name="Plot sum of hit values">
			Check this if the y-axis should show the sum of
			the values in the activity column.
		</option>
		<option name="Plot hits">
			Check this and enter a threshold if the y-axis
			should show the sum of data points that have values equal to or
			greater
			than the threshold.
		</option>
		<option name="Plot discovered clusters">
			Check this if the y-axis should show the number of
			discovered clusters. A cluster is considered to be found once the set
			number of molecules in this cluster has been found.
		</option>
		<option name="Fraction sizes (in %)">
			Size of the fractions to calculate the discovery
			rates and enrichment factors of.
		</option>
		<option name="Sort column">
			Select the column by which the rows should be
			sorted and plotted as the x-axis.
		</option>
		<option name="Activity column">
			Select the column that contains the activity
			values.
		</option>
		<option name="Sort descending">
			Checking this before adding a curve sorts the data
			points in the sort column descendingly instead of ascendingly. This
			is a setting specific to each curve.
		</option>

		<inPort index="0" name="Input table">
			Input data with values to sort by and

		<outPort index="0" name="Areas under curve">
			A one-column table with the area(s)
			under the enrichment curve(s)
		</outPort>
		<outPort index="1" name="Discovery rates + enrichment factors">
			Table with the discovery rates (either
			hits or clusters) for the different curves at the selected faction
			sizes. Also contains the enrichment factors which describe how many
			times better the given order is compared to a random order.
