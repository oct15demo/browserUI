The idea behind the <code>BasicPlotter</code> is to provide a small fraction of the 
functionality known from "R" or "GnuPlot", if you have some basic elements, 
such as lines, ellipses, rectangles, you want to add to your view you can use 
the <code>BasicPlotter</code>.
<pre> 
addLine(double[] yValues, Color color, Stroke stroke)
addLine(double[] xValues, double[] yValues, Color color, Stroke stroke)
addRectangle(double x, double y, int width, int height, Color color, Stroke stroke, boolean filled)
addEllipse(double xCenter, double yCenter, double width, double height, Color color, Stroke stroke, boolean filled)
</pre>

The usage of the <code>BasicPlotter</code> methods only makes sense, if the 
the domain values of the elements are known but not the mapped values. 
One example is a scatter plot where you want to add a regression line. 
Here only the domain values of the line are known and can simply be added as a line 
to the plotter with the domain values. 
The <code>BasicPlotter</code> will map the domain values to the drawing pane's size. 
If you set <code>preserve = true</code> in the <code>AbstractPlotter</code> the 
existing ranges of the coordinates won't be adapted. If you set preserve to false, 
the ranges will be adapted if, for example, the added rectangle is larger than 
the existing range of the coordinates.
Another possibility is to add a <code>DataArray</code> which will be visualized 
with a line connecting all values in the columns, where the row number is the 
x axis and the value of the column is painted at the y axis.
<pre>
addLine(DataArray data, int columnIndex, Color color, Stroke stroke)
</pre>

If you want to add a specific element to the <code>BasicPlotter</code> you can 
extend the <code>BasicDrawingElement</code> or the <code>Basic2DDrawingElement</code> 
(described below) with
<pre>
addBasicDrawingElement(BasicDrawingElement element)
</pre>

<p>
<h3>BasicDrawingElement and Basic2DDrawingElement</h3>

A <code>BasicDrawingElement</code> consists of a number of domain values and the 
referring mapped points, a color and a stroke. Whenever the size is changed, 
the <code>BasicPlotter</code> takes the domain values and maps them to the 
current drawing pane size. How the <code>BasicDrawingElement</code> is actually 
painted (depending on the given points) is defined in the paint method which is 
abstract. The <code>Basic2DDrawingElement</code> extends the 
<code>BasicDrawingElement</code> by holding a flag, whether the form should be 
filled or not.
Thus, if you want to add, for example, a triangle you have to extend the 
<code>Basic2DDrawingElement</code> then assert that the given points are the 
left corner, the top and the right corner and define the paint method to connect 
the points or fill the shape.

<h3>BasicDrawingPane</h3>

You can add <code>BasicDrawingElements</code> to the <code>BasicDrawingPane</code>, 
get them and clear the <code>BasicDrawingElements</code> with the following methods:
<pre>
addDrawingElement(BasicDrawingElement element)
getDrawingElements()
clearPlot()
</pre>
