	<fullDescription>
		<intro>		
	    <p>Creates a scatterplot of two selectable attributes. Then each datapoint is
	    displayed as a dot at its corresponding place, dependent on it's values
	    of the selected attributes. The dots are displayed in the color defined by
        the Color Manager, the size defined by the Size Manager, and the shape
        defined by the Shape Manager.
		</p>
		
	   <p><b>Only columns with a valid domain are available in this view.
        Make sure that the predecessor node is executed or set the domain 
        with the DomainCalculator node!</b></p>
		
		<h3>HiLiting:</h3>
		<p> The data points may be selected by either dragging
		a rectangle with the mouse over the points or 
		by clicking on points.
		Hold control pressed for multiple selection. 
		The selected datapoints may be 
		hilited by either right-click to get the context menu or via the hilite
		menu in the menu bar.</p>
		
		<h3>Tooltip</h3>
		<p>
		Move the mouse over the data points to get detailed information about 
		the data point (Row ID, and the x and y value).
		</p>
		
		<h3>Properties: </h3>
		<p>Default Settings:
			<ul>
			<li>Mouse Mode: choose "Selection" to select the datapoints or
			"Zooming" to zoom in. If you have zoomed in you may choose "Moving" 
			to navigate in the zoomed display.</li>
			<li>"Fit to screen" fits the display again to the available space.</li>
			<li>"Background color lets you choose the background color of the display. </li>
			<li>"Anti-aliasing": Check if the view should enable anti-aliasing
        (make a smoother drawing). This will slow down performance as well.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>Column Selection:
		Choose the columns you want to have displayed as x and y coordinate.
		With the "X attribute" and "Y attribute" spinners the range of the axes
		can be adjusted. The left spinner changes the lower end, the right 
		spinner the upper end.
		</p>
		<p>Appearance:
			<ul>
			<li>"Dot Size" lets you define the size of the dots.</li>
			<li>"Jitter": if a nominal column is selected you may adjust how much
			the values are jittered (scattered around there origin).</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		</intro>
		<option name="Nr. of rows to display">Enter the maximum number of rows
		the plotter should display. Setting a higher value than the default value 
		might dramatically decrease performance.</option>
		<option name="Ignore columns with more nominal values than:">
			Enter the maximum number of distinct nominal values that the
			view should consider. Columns with more values than the
			specified number will be ignored and can't be selected in
			the view. Please also note that nominal values must be
			present in the table specification of the input table (check
			it by inspecting the table spec tab of the predecessor's
			outport view). If no nominal values are present in the
			table, execute the predecessor or consider to use the 
			"Domain Calculator" node and to enforce the determination of 
			the nominal values.
