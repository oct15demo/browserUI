/**
 * A convenient <code>JPanel</code> which defines some distances and a default 
 * name for this and can be added as a tab to the 
 * {@link org.knime.base.node.viz.plotter.AbstractPlotterProperties}. 
 * This can then be done with this simple code:
 * <pre>
 * public SomePlotterProperties() {
        m_someTab = new SomeTab();
        addTab(m_someTab.getDefaultName(), m_someTab);
    }
   </pre>
 * The idea behind the organization of the properties into very small functional
 * units is that it is reusable. If, for instance, a tab is defined to show or 
 * hide dots this may be useful for several plotters, whereas the properties as 
 * a collection of all this tabs may be to special to extend and reuse it as a
 * whole.
