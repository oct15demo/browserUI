<p>
This package contains a default node implementation which can be used if a 
simple plotter is implemented, which displays data from one inport and also 
wants to display only a restricted number of rows.
The <a href="DefaultVisualizationNodeModel.html">DefaultVisualizationNodeModel</a>
reads in the data from inport 0, stores it in a <code>DataArray</code> and 
provides it by the <code>getDataArray()</code> method of the 
<a href="../DataProvider.html">DataProvider</a> interface. Also the maximum 
number of rows to display is read from the settings and the data is saved and 
loaded in the <code>loadInternals</code> and <code>saveInternals</code> methods.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="DefaultVisualizationNodeDialog.html">DefaultVisualizationNodeDialog</a>
lets the user define the maximum number to display.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="DefaultVisualizationNodeView.html">DefaultVisualizationNodeView</a>
holds one or more plotter instances and calls the appropriate methods.
Either a <code>DefaultVisualizationNodeView</code> can be created with one 
plotter as the argument or the <code>addVisualization</code> method can be used, 
which adds another tab with the passed plotter.
</p>
<p> 
If these default components are used only a NodeFactory has to be defined like in 
the example shown below:</p>
<pre>
    /**
     * @see org.knime.core.node.NodeFactory#createNodeDialogPane()
     */
    protected NodeDialogPane createNodeDialogPane() {
        return new DefaultVisualizationNodeDialog();
    }

    /**
     * @see org.knime.core.node.NodeFactory#createNodeModel()
     */
    public NodeModel createNodeModel() {
        return new DefaultVisualizationNodeModel();
    }

    /**
     * @see org.knime.core.node.NodeFactory#createNodeView(int, 
     * org.knime.core.node.NodeModel)
     */
    public NodeView createNodeView(final int viewIndex, 
            final NodeModel nodeModel) {
        return new DefaultVisualizationNodeView(nodeModel, new YourPlotter());
    }

    /**
     * @see org.knime.core.node.NodeFactory#getNrNodeViews()
     */
    protected int getNrNodeViews() {
        return 1;
    }

    /**
     * @see org.knime.core.node.NodeFactory#hasDialog()
     */
    protected boolean hasDialog() {
        return true;
    }
</pre>
</body>
