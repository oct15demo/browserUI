 *  Additional permission relating to nodes for KNIME that extend the Node
 *  Extension (and in particular that are based on subclasses of NodeModel,

<body>
Contains the implementation of a node which writes the content of a data table 
into an ARFF file. ARFF files are ASCII data files. They consist of a header, 
specifying the structure and format of the data, and a data section which 
contains the actual data vectors. The writer creates standard ARFF files, sparse
ARFF format is not supported yet. There is code in there for sparse file 
support, but as the reader as of now cannot read sparse files, we don't create
them either.<br>
See the <code>org.knime.base.node.io.arffreader</code> package for a 
detailed ARFF format description.
