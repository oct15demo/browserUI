	<shortDescription>
		Writes generic port objects to a file.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Writes generic port objects to a file or to a remote location denoted by an URL. The file can be read
		with the Model Reader node.<br />
         Note that if the destination location is a remote URL not all options are available because in general it's
         not possible to determine whether the remote location exists. In this case it will always be overwritten.  
		</intro>
        <option name="Selected File">Enter a valid file name or URL. You can also 
        choose a previously selected location from the drop-down list, or select a local 
        file from the "Browse..." dialog.</option>
        <option name="Overwrite OK">
            If unchecked, the node refuses to execute when the output 
            file exists (prevent unintentional overwrite).
        </option>
