	<name>Database GroupBy</name>
	<shortDescription>
		The Database GroupBy allows to group by the selected
		columns and output aggregated data to the generated groups.
	</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
           <p>
			This node allows rows to be grouped by the selected columns from the input database table. 
            Within the dialog, an SQL GROUP BY clause is interactively created by selecting the columns to group by
			and the columns to aggregate.
           </p>
           <p>
           The columns to aggregate can be either defined by selecting the columns directly, 
           by name based on a search pattern or based on the data type. Input columns are handled in
           this order and only considered once e.g. columns that are added directly on the
           "Manual Aggregation" tab are ignored even if their name matches a search pattern on the 
           "Pattern Based Aggregation" tab or their type matches a defined type on the
           "Type Based Aggregation" tab. The same holds for columns that are added based on a search pattern. 
           They are ignored even if they match a criterion that has been defined in the "Type Based Aggregation" tab.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Manual Aggregation" tab allows you to change the aggregation method of more than one 
            column. In order to do so select the columns to change, open the context menu with a right mouse click
            and select the aggregation method to use.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the "Pattern Based Aggregation" tab you can assign aggregation methods to columns based on a  
            search pattern. The pattern can be either a string with wildcards or a
            <a href="http://www.java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum">regular expression</a>.
            Columns where the name matches the pattern but where the data type is not compatible with the
            selected aggregation method are ignored. Only columns that have not been selected as group column or 
            that have not been selected as aggregation column on the "Manual Aggregation" tab are considered.
           </p>
           <p>
            The "Type Based Aggregation" tab allows to select an aggregation method for all columns of a certain 
            data type e.g. to compute the mean for all numerical columns (DoubleCell). Only columns that have not 
            been handled by the other tabs e.g. group, column based and pattern based are considered.
            The data type list to choose from contains basic types e.g String, Double, etc. and all data types 
            the current input table contains.
           </p>
            <p>
            A detailed description of the available aggregation methods can be
            found on the 'Description' tab in the node dialog.

                with KNI followed by a fourth character.
