        <intro>
         Modifies the input SQL query from a incoming database connection.
         The SQL query is represented by the place holder #table# and will be
         replaced during execute. The new database connection is then available
         at the out-port. The database connection settings itself are not 
         modified. 
        </intro>
        
        <option name="SQL Statement">
          Enter a new database query. Don't remove the #table# place
          holder which represents the incoming SQL statement.
          <br/>
          Additional SQL commands (create, drop, set parameter, etc.) can be 
          added before the actual SELECT statement and are executed 
          together, line-by-line during configure and execute. Note, those 
          additional SQL commands need to be separated by semicolon.
        </option>
        <option name="Flow Variable List">
            The list contains the flow variables that are currently available at
            the node input. Double clicking any of the entries will insert the
            respective identifier at the current cursor position (replacing the
            selection, if any).
