    <shortDescription>
        Reads a model from a PMML port and writes it into a PMML v4.0 compliant file.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This nodes writes a PMML model from a PMML model port into a PMML v4.0 compliant 
        file or to a remote location denoted by an URL. If a PMML file from another version is read by the PMML Reader and 
        directly written by this node, it is converted into PMML v4.0. 
        If the model is not valid (unknown data types, etc.) an exception is 
        thrown during execution. <br />
         Note that if the destination location is a remote URL not all options are available because in general it's
         not possible to determine whether the remote location exists. In this case it will always be overwritten.        
        </intro>
        <option name="Output location">Enter a valid file name or URL. You can also 
        choose a previously selected location from the drop-down list, or select a local 
        file from the "Browse..." dialog. 
        </option>
        <option name="Overwrite OK">
            If unchecked, the node refuses to execute when the output 
            file exists (prevent unintentional overwrite).
