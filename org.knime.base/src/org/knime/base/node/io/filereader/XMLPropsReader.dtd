    This file contains the validation set of properties for all XML files read by the
    FileTableSpec class. 
    
    Each XML specification must have an URL which specifies where to find the input data file
    a column_/row_header and delimiter and optional values such as line and 
    block_comment, escape_, and quote_ char.
    
    For now, all character settings are string representation and are
    therefore not limited. In addition, each XML files keeps an unique version
    number which enable us to be upward compatible for later releases.
