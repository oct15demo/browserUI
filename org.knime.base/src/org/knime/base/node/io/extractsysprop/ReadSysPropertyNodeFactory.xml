	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Reads system properties, 
            including current user name and working directory. The fields are 
            extracted using the <pre>java.lang.System#getProperties()</pre> 
            method.   
        </intro>
        <option name="Fail if property not present in runtime environment">
            If selected and any chosen property is not available in the 
            current runtime environment, the node will fail upon execution. 
            If not selected and any property is not present, the node will
            silently ignore this property.
            <p>
            This option is important if the workflow is run on a different 
            system/machine than it was configured on, e.g. when used in a 
            compute cluster environment or on a central server.
            </p>
        </option>
        <option name="Extract all available properties">
            If selected all available runtime properties are extracted.
            Note that the properties may vary when run on different systems.
