    <shortDescription> Flow variable CASE Switch to alter active branch of flow variable ports.

        <intro>
            <p>This nodes takes the flow variables from the input port and moves it to exactly one active output branch.
            </p>
            <p>
                NOTE - Due to the way in which flow variables are handled within KNIME, the flow variable values for any
                existing flow variables beyond the corresponding "end" node will always be those at the top-most port of
                the "end" node. New variables created in any active branch will retain their correct values. If you need
                to change the value of existing variables, please either use a new flow variable, or use a
                <i>Variable to Table Row</i>
                node before a conventional
                <i>End CASE</i>
                node.

        <option name="Activate all outputs during configuration step">
            When set the node will keep all outputs active during workflow configuration (that is, while
            the traffic light of the node is 'yellow'). This allows the configuration of connected downstream nodes and
            simplifies the workflow design at the expense of additional configuration calls of nodes that are later on
            inactive. It's recommended to switch this flag off for production workflows as this avoids unnecessary
            configuration calls of the inactive branches.
