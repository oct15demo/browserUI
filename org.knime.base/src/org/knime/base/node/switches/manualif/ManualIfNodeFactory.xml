    <shortDescription>
        Allows to manually control which branch the data will flow into.

        <intro>
			This node passes the data either to the top, bottom, or both
			output ports, depending on the configuration.
        </intro>
        <option name="Select active port">Select the active output port</option>
        <option name="Activate all outputs during configuration step">
            When set the node will keep all outputs active during workflow configuration (that is, while
            the traffic light of the node is 'yellow'). This allows the configuration of connected downstream nodes and
            simplifies the workflow design at the expense of additional configuration calls of nodes that are later on
            inactive. It's recommended to switch this flag off for production workflows as this avoids unnecessary
            configuration calls of the inactive branches.
