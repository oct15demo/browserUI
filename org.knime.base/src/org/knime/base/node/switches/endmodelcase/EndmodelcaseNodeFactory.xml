    <fullDescription>
        <intro> Merges two or more branches with arbitrary models which were initially created by an IF or CASE Switch
            Node. This nodes takes the objects from exactly one active branch - if multiple are active, the first 
            active port is used.
        </intro>
        <option name="If multiple inputs are active">
            Choose the expected behavior of the node if two or more inputs are active. The default behavior is to fail
            during executing. Alternatively you can pass on the first active input (hence ignore any subsequent active
            port). In case all inputs are inactive the node itself will pass on an inactive object as well.
