    <shortDescription>Creates a temporary directory upon execute and exposes

	<fullDescription>
        <intro>Creates a temporary directory upon execute and exposes
            its path as flow variable. This can be useful in (a) demo application where
            the actual path of the output is not all that relevant, e.g. the KNIME public
            workflow server and (b) KNIME WebPortal and quickform flows, where
            some data is written, which is later downloaded by means of, e.g. a web
            link.
        </intro>
        <option name="Directory base name">
           Name prefix of the temporary directory. It will be amended by some random
           number to ensure uniqueness.
        </option>
        <option name="Export path as (variable name)">
          The name of the exported variable denoting the actual path.
        </option>
        <option name="Delete directory on reset">
          Check this box to delete the directory and all its content when the node
          is reset or the workflow is closed.
        </option>
        <option name="Additional path variables">
          A list of additional variables that will be created by the node. Each variable
          will denote a path to a file (as opposed to a directory path), whereby the
          file name is given in the second (file name) column
        </option>
