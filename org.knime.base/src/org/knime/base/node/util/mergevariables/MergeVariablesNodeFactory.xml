    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
		Merges flow variables into one stream. This node aggregates variables 
		defined in different input connections into one variable connection. 
		It does not modify variables but only merges them. Note, if there are 
		the same variables defined in different inputs, the standard conflict 
		handling is applied: Top most inputs take priority and define the value 
		of a variable. This node can also be used as a common barrier point to 
		control the execution order of nodes, i.e. nodes connected to the output
		port will not start executing until all upstream nodes have been 
		executed.
