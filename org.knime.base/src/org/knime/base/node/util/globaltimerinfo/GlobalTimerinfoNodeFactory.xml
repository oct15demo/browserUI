        <intro>
            <p>This node reports collected usage information for nodes for the life span of this KNIME installation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The output table at the first output lists all nodes that were created or executed during the life time
                of this installation. It contains the following information:
                <ul>
                    <li>Name: java class name of the node (unique identifier of the implementation)</li>
                    <li>Aggregate Execution Time: aggregated execution times of all instances of that node (in milli
                        seconds)</li>
                    <li>Overall Nr of Executions: how often instances of this node implementation were executed</li>
                    <li>Overall Nr of Creations: how many instances were manually created (not counting copy and paste
                        actions)
                    </li>
                    <li>Likely Successor: the most likely successor for each node; this information is likely not that
                        useful for a single installation but provides us at KNIME with aggregate usage statistics and
                        will allows us to provide recommendations in the future
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The second port shows all installed features of this KNIME installation together with their version
                numbers.
