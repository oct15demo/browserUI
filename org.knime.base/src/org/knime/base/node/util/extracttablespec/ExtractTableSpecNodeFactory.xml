        <intro>
			Node extracting the meta information from the input table (column 
			names, types, etc.) The meta information is referred to as the 
			table data specification and contains information such as column 
			names, types, domain values (list of possible values for 
			categorical columns) and lower and upper bounds. It also contains 
			the information which of the columns have a view handler associated
		   (optional operation). Each column in the input table is represented 
		   as a row in the output. This node can be used in conjunction with 
		   the Insert Column Header node, where the column names are extracted 
		   from the input table, then modified in the workflow and later merged 
		   back into the main table. 			
		</intro>
		<option name="Extract property handlers">
			If checked the information which of the columns have property 
			handlers e.g. color handler associated is extracted, otherwise not.

            possible values, otherwise not.
