        <intro>
			Node collecting variables created in a loop. This node closes a 
			loop but does not aggregate data created in the loop but only 
			variables. It can be used to close loops where all the magic 
			happens in the loop itself and no aggregated output is needed. One 
			instance could be a loop over a list of files, whereby each file 
			is processed in one loop iteration (including writing one output 
			file for each input).
