            Node at the end of a loop, collecting the intermediate 
            results by joining the tables on their row IDs. In each iteration
            the node will join the current input table with the previous result.
            The join is based on the row ID on the incoming tables.
        </p>
        <p>
            The typical use case of this node is that you calculate a set of
            new columns in the loop body and then feed only the newly created
            columns to this loop end node. It will join all intermediate results
            (the results from each iteration) using a join operation 
            (full outer join on the RowID column). It is strongly recommended
            that you filter the original input data from the input as it will
            otherwise occur multiple times in the joined output. Use a Joiner 
            node following this loop end node in order to join the result with
            the original input data (the data provided to the loop start node).

        <option name="Loop has same row IDs in each iteration">
           Check this box if the tables in each iteration have the same number of
           rows and the same row ordering. If this option is selected, the node does
           not use an expensive join (requires table sorting) but only puts tables
           side-by-side. This option does not have any influence on the output table. If
           the tables do not have the same row IDs and this option is selected, the 
           node will fail during execution.
