    <name>Backward Feature Elimination Filter</name>

    <shortDescription>Applies a feature filter model built during backward feature elimination</shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node takes a model built with a feature elimination loop and lets you choose the column you want to
            include in the output table. The dialog will show you all computed levels of the feature elimination
            together with the error rates. You may then either select one level ("manual selection") or you specify an
            error threshold and then the level with the fewest features that has a prediction error below the threshold
            is automatically selected. In any case all columns from the input table that are not present in the selected
            level are filtered from the input table.<br />
            You may optionally include the target column. Note that the column names must be the same as the ones used for the
            elimination loop. If they are  not, rename them first.

        <option name="Include target column">
            If checked, that target column is included in the output table, otherwise it is also
            filtered out (if it
            exists)

        <option name="Select features manually">By selecting this option you can choose a set of features in the level table below.</option>

        <option name="Prediction error threshold">Enter a prediction error threshold here. The level with the fewest number of features that is below the threshold will be selected automatically.</option>       
        <option name="Level table">
            Shows the levels (i.e. number of features) and the corresponding error rates. You may click
