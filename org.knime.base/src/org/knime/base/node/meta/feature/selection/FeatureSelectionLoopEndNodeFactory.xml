	<shortDescription>End node for a feature selection loop</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			This is the end of a feature selection loop which selects features according to a feature selection
			strategy. It allows you to select a flow variable that contains a prediction score (usually from a
			preceding <i>Scorer</i> node). You then need to specify whether the score variable should be minimized or
			maximized.
		</intro>

		<option name="Score variable">The flow variable that contains the score for the model</option>
		<option name="Minimize">Check this option if you want to minimize the score (if you use error as score, for example, and you want to minimize error).  If the option is left unchecked, the score will be maximized.</option>
