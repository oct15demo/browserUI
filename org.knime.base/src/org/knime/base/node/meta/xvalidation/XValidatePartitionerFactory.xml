    <shortDescription>Data partitioner for use in a cross-validation flow</shortDescription>

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
            This node is the first in a cross validation loop. At the end of the loop there must be a X-Aggregator to
            collect the results from each iteration. All nodes in between these two node are executed as many times as
            iterations should be performed.
        </intro>
        <option name="Number of validations">
            The number of cross validation iterations that should be performed.
        </option>
        <option name="Random sampling">
            If checked, the partitions are sampled randomly from the input table, otherwise it is cut into consecutive
            pieces.
        </option>
        <option name="Stratified sampling">
            If checked, the partitions are sampled randomly but the class distribution from the column selected
            below is maintained.
        </option>
        <option name="Random seed">
            For random and stratified sampling you can choose a seed for the random number
            generator in order to get reproducible results. Otherwise you get different
            partitions every time.
        </option>        
        <option name="Class column name">The name of the column with the class labels.</option>
        <option name="Leave-one-out">
            Performs a leave-one-out cross validation, i.e. there are as many iterations as data points and in each
            iteration another point's target value is predicted by using all remaining points as training set.
