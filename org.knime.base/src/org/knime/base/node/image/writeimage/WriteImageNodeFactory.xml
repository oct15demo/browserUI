	<name>Image Port Writer</name>
	<shortDescription>Writes a image port object to a file.</shortDescription>
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>Writes a image port object to a file or a remote location denoted by a URL. The image input object must
	       contain a valid image as otherwise the node will fail 
	       during executing. The Image extension is chosen based on the given image type.
        <br />
         Note that if the destination location is a remote URL not all options are available because in general it's
         not possible to determine whether the remote location exists. In this case it will always be overwritten.           </intro>
		<option name="Output file">
		  Specify the output location. The target folder must already exist.
		</option>
		<option name="Overwrite OK">
		  Select this to allow the node to overwrite any existing file. If 
		  unselected and the file exists, the node will fail during execution.
		</option>
