    <name>Image Column Writer</name>
    <shortDescription>Writes all in a column images to a directory.</shortDescription>
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>This node takes all images in a certain column of the input table
            and writes them, each as a separate
            file, into a directory in the
            file system or to a remote location denoted by a URL. The files will be named after the table's row keys.
        <br />
         Note that if the destination location is a remote URL not all options are available because in general it's
         not possible to determine whether the remote location exists. In this case it will always be overwritten.            
            </intro>
        <option name="Image column">Select the column containing the image cells here.</option>
        <option name="Selected directory">Select the output location here. You can also specify remote URLs, in this
            case the final destination URLs are built by directly appending the file name to this base URL.
        </option>
        <option name="Overwrite existing files">Choose if existing files should be overwritten here. If this option is unchecked, the node
            will fail if a file already exists.</option>
