interesting to see code here too https://bitbucket.org/KNIME/knime-core/overview

The following setup will get a new clean knime codebase with the Knime code required 
to create a browser UI version of the knime application. The setup of additional code and
modifications needed to implement the browser UI will be addressed in a separate how-to file.
This setup below merely assembles all the original source code needed for the big hack.

********* Getting the basic Knime application source code ***********
 
the instructions to setup a knime development environment are here 
   https://github.com/knime/knime-sdk-setup
After setting up by cloning the knime-sdk-setup project, and following directions under
   Getting Started
You should then have three projects appearing in Eclipse
   org.apache.xmlbeans, org.knime.example.node, and org.knime.sdk.setup.
next clone the knime-core project, as per instructions here 
   Work with Source of KNIME Analytics Platform Extensions
this will get you knime core and knime base ("Extensions" is just a technical term,
core and base are the main projects that comprise the knime application)
under the knime-core directory, you will find and import org.knime.base and org.knime.core eclipse projects

The following additional setup must be followed to use the knime labs code from
jsView to handle the results of a workflow and display them in a browser window. 
jsView converts the Knime table data structue to javascript and is also configurable. 
There is an additional hack to get this to work, but first just toget set up in IDE 
*************** Getting the jsView from Knime Labs *******************

From Eclipse menu, select
Help, Install New Software
As per instructions on knime page https://www.knime.com/downloads/update
copy update url from that page, http://update.knime.org/analytics-platform/3.4/ as of this writing
and enter url in the input field labeled 
   work with:
enter any name you want in pop up window with url
if you've previously used the url to add software it will appear as a selection already
  
under Knime Labs Extensions select 
   KNIME Javascript Views
   KNIME Webservice Client
under Sources select 
   Source for KNIME Javascript Views
   Source for KNIME Webservice Client

complete process by following prompts in wizard to install

*********** Hacky Way of Installing jsView source code ***************

from the eclipse installation, go to dir
   Eclipse.app/Contents/Eclipse/plugins
make a directory somewhere to unpack the js.views jar, for example
   mkdir Documents/jsview
copy the js.views jar from the plugins dir to tmp dir
   cp org.knime.js.views.source_3.4.1.v201709070952.jar Documents/jsview
unjar the jar
   jar xf org.knime.js.views.source_3.4.1.v201709070952.jar
go to wherever you cloned the knime core project
   cd /Applications/KnimeFromGit
here you would find two directories
   knime-core   knime-sdk-setup
go to org/knime dir within org.knime.base project   
   cd knime-core/org.knime.base/src/org/knime
copy the js.views files here, recursively with -r option
   cp -r Documents/jsview/org/knime/js .

there are a few plugin dependencies needed still
open the MANIFEST.MF file found under the META-INF in the org.knime.base project
go to the dependencies tab (tabs appear on bottom of file window) and add the following plugins
  org.knime.js.core
  com.google.guava
  org.knime.ext.svg
  org.apache.commons.lang3
  
Also you may have to move the org.knime.core dependency to the the top (select and use up button)

************ To fix remaining errors from abstract method not implemented ********

An abstract method added in August 2017 is not implemented in several jsView descendant classes as of Oct 23, 2017

go to org.knime.core.node.wizard.WizardNode, comment out the method declaration and insert a default implementation 

Here is an example of code after modification with hack and some documentation of such
     
     /**
     * Property set in the configuration dialog to the node to skip this node in the wizard execution.
     * @param hide true if node is to be skipped, false otherwise
     * @since 3.5
     */
    //public void setHideInWizard(final boolean hide);
    /*public void setHideInWizard(final boolean hideInWizard) {
        m_hideInWizard = hideInWizard;
    }*/
    //public void setHideInWizard(final boolean hide);
    default public void setHideInWizard(final boolean hideInWizard) {
    }
    
*************** Getting js.core source from zip file ******************

the org.knime.js.core directory org.knime.js.core_3.4.1.v201709070952 
that contains a jar of class files can be added from Eclipse menu, select
   Help, Install New Software
as described above in ***Getting the jsView from Knime Labs***

But the source is missing from the sources list and must presently be obtained 
by downloading the zipped file of all the plugins, roughly 3 GB, and as unzip 
retains the zip file, you'll need 6.1 GB
As per instructions on https://www.knime.com/downloads/update, the link appear here
   KNIME Analytics Platform: download KNIME Update Site
The actual url of the link being   
   https://update.knime.org/analytics-platform/UpdateSite_latest34.zip
create to separate directory to hold the zip file and subsequent unzipped dirs and 
files, then find the dir with 
   find ./|grep js.core
   .//org.knime.update.org/plugins/org.knime.js.core.source_3.4.1.v201709070952.jar
   .//org.knime.update.org/plugins/org.knime.js.core_3.4.1.v201709070952.jar

follow similar procedure (hack) used for jsView. cp source jar to a dir

make a directory somewhere to unpack the js.views jar, for example
   mkdir Documents/jscore
copy the js.core jar from the plugins dir to tmp dir
   cp org.knime.js.core.source_3.4.1.v201709070952.jar Documents/jsview
unjar the jar
   jar xf org.knime.js.core.source_3.4.1.v201709070952.jar
go to wherever you cloned the knime core project
   cd /Applications/KnimeFromGit
here you would find two directories
   knime-core   knime-sdk-setup
go to org/knime dir within org.knime.base project   
   cd knime-core/org.knime.base/src/org/knime
copy the js.views files here, recursively with -r option
   cp -r Documents/jscore/org/knime/js .

again there are a several plugin dependencies needed still
open the MANIFEST.MF file found under the META-INF in the org.knime.base project
go to the dependencies tab (tabs appear on bottom of file window) and add the following plugins
  com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-core
  com.fasterxml.jackson.core.jackson-databind
  org.eclipse.jface
  org.elcipse.ui.workbench
  org.apache.commons.codec
  org.openqa.selenium
  org.knime.ext.phantomjs
  org.knime.time

 
******* extraneous note on identifying missing dependencies**********

Looking to identify missing dependency to find import in 7 jsView files for
   import org.knime.base.data.xml.SvgCell;
Using knime search yielded no result for org.knime.base.data.xml.SvgCell or org.knime.base.data.xml, 
searching for just SvgCell will work, but pasting in google came up with this:
  
   https://www.knime.com/forum/knime-developers/cannot-find-orgknimebasedataxml-package-anywhere

which identified 
   org.knime.ext.svg
as the missing dependency to add, saving some probable trial and error, fortunately this had been posted in the
forum just 13 days prior on Oct 10, 2017
