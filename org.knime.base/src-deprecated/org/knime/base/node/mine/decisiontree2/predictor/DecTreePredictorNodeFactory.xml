	<shortDescription>
	    Uses an existing decision tree to compute class labels for input vectors.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>		
		This node uses an existing decision tree (passed in through the model
		port) to predict the class value for new patterns.
		The Node can be configured as follows:
		</intro>
		
		<option name="Number of patterns for HiLite">
		Determines the maximum number of patterns the tree will store to
		support HiLiting.
		</option>		
		<option name="Append columns with normalized class distribution">
        Shows the normalized class distribution for each prediction.
        </option>
