	<name>Naive Bayes Predictor</name>
	
	<shortDescription>
		Uses the naive Bayes model from the naive Bayes learner to predict 
		the class membership of each row in the input data.
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			Predicts the class per row based on the learned model. The class
			probability is the product of the probability per attribute and the
			probability of the class attribute itself. 
			<p>
			The probability for nominal values is the number of occurrences of 
			the class value with the given value divided by the number of total 
			occurrences of the class value. The probability of numerical values 
			is calculated by assuming a normal distribution per attribute.
			</p>
		</intro>
		<option name="Append probability value column per class instance">
		    If selected a column is appended for each class instance with the
		    normalized probability of this row being member of this class.
	    </option>
	    <option name="Laplace corrector">
            Initial count for nominal attributes to overcome zero counts.
            Set to zero for no correction.
