		<intro>
			This node creates a list with the locations and URLs of the
			files contained in one or more given folders (content of sub folders
			can be listed as well). It is possible to apply a filter on the 
			files, so that only the files of interests are included in the 
			resulting list.	There are 3 filters available: file 
			extension(s), wildcard pattern or regular expression.
         </intro>

		<option name="Location(s):">Select the folders to be scanned</option>
		<option name="Filter:">
			Specifies the filter to be applied:
			<br />
			<ul>
				<li> none: all files will be included</li>
				<li> regular expression: only the files matching the regular
					expression will be included.</li>
				<li> wildcard pattern: only the files matching the wildcard pattern
					will be included.</li>
				<li> extension(s): only the files with the right extension will be
					included.</li>
			</ul>
		</option>

		<option name="Extensions / expression:">Define the file extension(s),
			a wildcard pattern or a regular expression for the filter. For
			multiple extensions ";" acts as the separator. This option is 
			ignored	if no filter is selected.
        </option>

		<option name="Include sub folders:">If enabled the content of the
			sub folders will be included as well. If disabled sub folders will be
			ignored.
