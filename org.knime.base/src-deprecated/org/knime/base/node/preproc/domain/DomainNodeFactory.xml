	    Determines domain information of selected columns.

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
		Scans the data and updates the possible values list and/or the min-
		and max values of selected columns. This node is useful when the
		domain information of the data has changed and must be updated in
		the table specification, for instance, the domain information as 
		contained in a table spec may be void when a row filtering (e.g.
		outlier removal) is carried out. 
		</intro>
		
		<option name="Possible Values">
		<p>
		Include the columns, for which possible values shall be determined and
		be put in the table specification. The default dialog option selects
		all columns, which can represent themselves as String. For all 
		non-selected columns (the Exclude list) the possible value domain will 
		be dropped or retained, depending on the selection of the corresponding
		buttons below the Exclude list.
		</p>
		<p>You can also restrict the number of different values using the 
		checkbox and the accompanying spinner at the bottom of this tab. 
		If there are more possible values than set in the spinner, all values 
		are discarded and the column's meta information won't support querying 
		the possible values.
		</p>
		</option>
		<option name="Min &amp; Max">
		Select all columns for which min and max values shall be determined. The
		default dialog option includes all &quot;boundable&quot; columns, for
		instance numeric ones. Also select what happens with columns in the 
		Exclude	list, i.e. either dropping the min/max domain that is available
		in the input table or retaining it.
