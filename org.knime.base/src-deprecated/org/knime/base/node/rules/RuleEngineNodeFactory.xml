	<name>Rule Engine</name>
	<shortDescription>
		 Applies user-defined business rules to the input table
	</shortDescription>
	
	<fullDescription>
		<intro>This node takes a list of user-defined rules and tries to match them to each
        row in the input table. If a rule matches, its outcome value is added into a new column.
        The rules follow a limited SQL-like syntax:
        <pre>
RULE := BEXPR '=&gt;' STRING | NUMBER | COL
BEXPR := '(' BEXPR ')' |
         'NOT' BEXPR |
         'MISSING' COL |
         AEXPR (BINOP BEXPR)?
AEXPR := COL OP COL |
         NUMBER OP COL |
         COL OP NUMBER |
         STRING OP COL |
         COL OP STRING |
         COL LOP STRINGLIST
BOP := 'AND' | 'OR' | 'XOR'
OP := '&gt;' | '&lt;' | '&gt;=' | '&lt;=' | '=' | 'LIKE'
LOP := 'IN'
STRING := '&quot;' [^"]* '&quot;'
NUMBER := [1-9][0-9]*(\.[0-9]+)?
COL := '$' [^$]+ '$'
STRINGLIST := '(' STRING (',' STRING)* ')'
        </pre>
        <p>
	 	Rules consist of a condition part (antecedant), that must evaluate to <i>true</i>
        or <i>false</i>, and an outcome (consequent) that is put into the new column if the rule matches.
        The most simple rule is a comparison between a column and another column, a fixed number or string.
        The LIKE operator treats the fixed string as a wildcard pattern (with * and ?) as wildcards,
        the IN operator compares the column value to a list of strings and evaluates to <i>true</i> if at least
        one value in the list is equal to the column's value. Note that all operators are case-sensitive!
        </p>
        <p>The outcome of a rule can either be a fixed string, a fixed number, or a reference to another column. The
        type of the outcome column is the common super type of all possible outcomes including the default label. If the outcome
        of a single rule or the default label is a reference to a column, please check the corresponding option below
        the text field.        
        </p>
        <p>
        Columns are given by their name surrounded by $, numbers are given in the usual decimal representation. Note that
        strings must not contain double-quotes.
        </p>
        <p>Rules can (and should) be grouped with brackets because there is not pre-defined
        operator precedence for the boolean operators (comparison operators always take precedence
        over boolean operators).</p>
        <p>Some example rules:</p>
        <pre>
        $Col0$ > 5 => "Positive"
        $Col0$ = "Active" AND $Col1$" &lt;= 5 => "Outlier"
        $Col0$ LIKE "Market Street*" AND 
            ($Col1 IN ("married", "divorced") 
                OR $Col2$ > 40) => "Strange"
        $Col0$ > 5 => $Col1$
        </pre>
