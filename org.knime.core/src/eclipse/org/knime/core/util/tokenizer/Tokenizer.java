/**
 * This class reads tokens from a stream and returns them as strings. <br>
 * You can specify token delimiters, comments and quotes. <br>
 * The tokenizer can be configured to include delimiters or to return them as
 * separate tokens, to discard, include, or return comments, to allow line
 * continuations, and to combine consecutive delimiters.
 * <p>
 * It always returns tokens as strings.
 * <p>
 * It returns <code>null</code> if it read EOF before any other character.
 * (EOF is always a token delimiter.)
 * <p>
 * It will always ignore a '\r' if it immediately is followed by a '\n'.
 * <p>
 * You can set multiple delimiter patterns. <br>
 * You can specify multiple block comment begin/end pair patterns. <br>
 * You can specify multiple line comment begin patterns. <br>
 * And you can specify multiple quote begin/end pair patterns - and an escape
 * character with each pair. <br>
 * A pattern is a (multi or single character) string. <br>
 * The discard/return/include option can be specified for each delimiter and
 * comment pattern separately.
 * <p>
 * You can specify a line continuation character. This character immediately
 * followed by a newline and any space or tab character will be ignored then
 * inside a token or quoted string.
 * <p>
 * You can push back one (the last) token.
