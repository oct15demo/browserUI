 * General interface for object specifications that are passed along node
 * connections. Most prominent example of such a class is
 * {@link org.knime.core.data.DataTableSpec}, which is used to represent table
 * specification. <code>PortObjectSpec</code> objects represent the
 * information that is necessary during a node's
 * {@link NodeModel#configure(PortObjectSpec[]) configuration step}.
 * They are assumed to be fairly small objects (usually reside in memory) and
 * describe the general structure of {@link PortObject} objects (which are
 * passed along the connections during a node's execution). Both the class of a
 * <code>PortObjectSpec</code> and a {@link PortObject} describe
 * {@link PortType}.

 * <b>Important:</b> Implementors of this interface must also provide a
 * {@link PortObjectSpecSerializer}, which is used to save and load instances. This serializer must be registered at the
 * extension pint <tt>org.knime.core.PortType</tt>.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> The API of this class is not finalized and may slightly change
