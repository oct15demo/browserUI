 * Implemented by nodes whose execution not only depends on the node configuration (dialog) but also on additional
 * runtime parameters. These are, for instance dialog values set via a metanode or subnode dialog. Also nodes having
 * a view that sets view values are "value controlled".
 *
 * <p>Nodes implementing this interface and whose dialog component implements {@link ValueControlledDialogPane} will
 * have an additional method called when the dialog is opened. This allows them to display the currently used value
 * in the configuration dialog. E.g. a string quickform input has a default value of "foo" but the value as per
 * subnode configuration dialog is "bar" -- this will then be shown in the main config dialog of the QF node to
 * clarify why the current output is "bar" although it says "foo" in the dialog.
