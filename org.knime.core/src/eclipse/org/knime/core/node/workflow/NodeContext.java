/**
 * A {@link NodeContext} holds information about the context in which an operation on a node is executed. This is used
 * for internal purposes, node implementors should not use this class.<br>
 * The node context is local to the current thread and is set by the workflow manager or the node container in which a
 * node is contained. Each thread has a stack of {@link NodeContext} objects, only the last set context can be retrieved
 * via {@link #getContext()}. You must absolutely make sure that if you push a new context that you remove it
 * afterwards. Therefore the common usage pattern is a follows:
 *
 * <pre>
 * NodeContext.pushContext(nodeContainer);
 * try {
 *     doSomething();
 * } finally {
 *     NodeContext.removeLastContext():
 * }
