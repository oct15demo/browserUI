/**
 * Utility class that keeps a list of recently used String, mostly
 * used in File-Reader and Writer that keep track of a list of recently
 * accessed file names. This class also makes sure that the list is made
 * persistent and saved to disk when the application closes. The list
 * is read again from file on startup.
 *
 * <p>Usage in a short way: Determine a (possibly unique) ID for your
 * history to use (I assume that there are not that many?) and get a history
 * object by invoking <code>StringHistory.getInstance(yourID)</code>. You
 * can add recently used String to this object by invoking the
 * <code>add(String)</code> method and get a list of String from the
 * <code>getHistory()</code> method which will return the history in the order
 * the add method on the String objects has been called with the last element
 * added being the first element in the history result.
