  <li><strong>What's a DataCell?</strong><br>
  A <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> is a container for a single entity.
  There are many different implementations of <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a>,
  for instance <a href="../def/StringCell.html">StringCell</a>, 
  <a href="../def/DoubleCell.html">DoubleCell</a>, <a href="../def/IntCell.html">IntCell</a>.
  <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a>s are contained in a <a href="../DataRow.html">DataRow</a>
  and DataRows are contained in a <a href="../DataTable.html">DataTable</a>. 
  DataCells implement different <a href="../DataValue.html">DataValue</a> interfaces and are associated to a
  DataType (see both descriptions below).</li>
  <li><strong>What's a DataValue?</strong><br>
  A <a href="../DataValue.html">DataValue</a> is an interface describing the
  content of a <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a>. (For example, how to
  access the double value from a DoubleCell.) It also brings along meta information
  such as renderers, icon and a comparator which is accessed statically using
  reflection through a singleton called <a
    href="../DataValue.UtilityFactory.html">UTILITY</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>What's a DataType?</strong><br>
  A <a href="../DataType.html">DataType</a> comprises the meta-information to a
  <a href="../DataCell.html">DataCell</a> implementation such as a compatibility
  list (to what <a href="../DataValue.html">DataValue</a>s the cells can be casted to), 
  available renderers, comparators and icon. The DataType is a property of
  a <a href="../DataColumnSpec.html">DataColumnSpec</a>. 
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>How do I determine the DataType of a DataCell
  implementation?</strong><br>
  Use <a href="../DataCell.html#getType()">DataCell#getType()</a>. It is a
  shortcut for <a href="../DataType.html#getType(java.lang.Class)">DataType.getType(SomeDataCell.class)</a>.
  Note that a DataCell instance does not carry a reference to its DataType but
  rather it determines the type through its runtime class (realized by a HashMap
  in DataType which maps DataCell classes to DataType).
  </li>
  <li>
 <strong>I want to create a new column for a DataTable and need
  to set the column's DataType. How do I do this?</strong><br>
  You need to know what DataCell instances you add to the column. For instance,
  if you only add DoubleCell objects, set the type as
  <code>DataType.getType(DoubleCell.class)</code>. (All default cell implementations
  provide a singleton for exactly this purpose, e.g. 
  <a href="../def/DoubleCell.html#TYPE">DoubleCell.TYPE</a>). 
  </li>
  <li>
 <strong>I don't know what cells I'm going to add to the new
  column. How do I set the DataType of the column?</strong><br>
  This should be a really rare case! One possible example is, when a
  table is transposed and the most general type for all cells in
  a table's row has to be determined. 
  You need to scan all cells and compute their most general DataType.
  This type may not be associated with any real DataCell implementation, but it
  will be valid for all DataCells that are contained in the column. Use the
  static method <code>DataType#getCommonSuperType(DataType, DataType)</code> in the class
  DataType. You need to call this method iteratively, for instance:
  <pre>                
	DataCell[] allCells = ...;
	DataType type = allCells[0].getType()
	for (int i = 1; i &lt; allCells.length; i++) {
		type = DataType.getCommonSuperType(type, allCells[i].getType());
	}
	// &quot;type&quot; will be the most specific super type of all found types.
	</pre>
  </li>
  <li>
  <strong>How about missing cells?</strong><br>
  The term "missing cell" does not really mean that there is no cell but simply
  that the cell at hand represents an unknown value. As a missing cell does not
  have any content, there is a singleton to use in case you want to represent
  such a missing entity. It is available through 
  <a href="../DataType.html#getMissingCell()">DataType.getMissingCell()</a>. This
  singleton's type is a special type, which is compatible to all DataValue
  interfaces you can think of. If you invoke 
  <a href="../DataType.html#isCompatible(java.lang.Class)">isCompatible(...)</a>
  on this type, it will always return true. However, trying to cast this missing
  cell to any DataValue will fail. Be advised to always check a cell's
  <code>isMissing()</code> method before typecasting it.
  </li>
  
  <li>
  <p><strong>When can I safely typecast a DataCell to a specific
  DataValue.</strong><br>
  There are two constraints: 
  <ol> 
  <li>The cell must not represent a missing value,
  i.e. <a href="../DataCell.html#isMissing()">cell.isMissing()</a> has to evaluate to
  false and
  </li> 
  <li>the cell's type allows you to do so, i.e. 
  <a href="../DataType.html#isCompatible(java.lang.Class)">type.isCompatible(SomeDataValue.class)</a>
  returns true. The second constraint also holds for the DataColumnSpec's type in which
  the cell is contained in. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
  Thus, you need to check once if the DataType as
  given by the DataColumnSpec is compatible to the DataValue interface of
  interest and if so, you can safely cast any DataCell from that column to the
  given DataValue unless it represents a missing value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>Are all cells in a data table column of the same type?</strong>
  <br>
  Not necessarily. All you can assume is that each DataValue interface for which
  the DataColumnSpec's type returns true on isCompatible(SomeDataValue.class), is
  implemented by all of the cells in the column unless they represent a missing
  value.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><strong>How do I implement support for a completely new kind
  of data type?</strong><br>
  See our <a href="newtypes.html#newtypes">manual</a> for that.</p>
