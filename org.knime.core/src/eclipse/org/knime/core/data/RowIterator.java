 * Use RowIterators as follows:

 *     DataTable table = ...;

 *         DataRow row = it.next();

 * 
 * <pre>
 *     DataTable table =...;
 *     for (DataRow row : table) {
 *       // access the row here
 *     }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Note, the difference of this class to a generic Iterator&lt;DataRow&gt; is
 * that it does not allow to remove elements.
