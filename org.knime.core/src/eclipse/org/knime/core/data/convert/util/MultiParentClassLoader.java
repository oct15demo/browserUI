/**
 * ClassLoader which searches through multiple ClassLoaders. Important for dynamic uses of the converter framework.
 * Allows creating a class loader which knows classes of org.knime.core.data.convert and the user bundle.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Example:</b>
 *
 * <pre>
 * final ClassLoader loader =
 *     new ClassLoader(getClass().getClassLoader(), DataCellToJavaConverterRegistry.class.getClassLoader());
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 *
 * A call to {@link ClassLoader#loadClass(String)} will now first check the <code>getClass().getClassLoader()</code> and
 * if that does not contain the class we are trying to load, it will check
 * <code>DataCellToJavaConverterRegistry.class.getClassLoader()</code>.
